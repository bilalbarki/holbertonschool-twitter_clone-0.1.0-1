I've been running seriously for 4 years now. As I was living in The Netherlands before coming to SF, I was used to running on flat routes and didn't get to run uphill much (except for that one sad lonely hill in the park next to my home). </p> <br> <div class="post-status-button-div" data-attribute="hidden"> <button class="button-reply">Reply</button> </div> <form class="hidden reply-form"> Reply:<br> <input type="text" name="reply"> <input type="radio" name="location" value="location"> Include location<br> <input type="submit" value="Post"> </form> </div> <hr> <div class="post"> <img class="article_img" src="4.jpg" alt="user siphan"> <h3>Siphan Bou</h3> <h4>February 6, 2016</h4> <br> <p> Having been living in SF for about 2 weeks, I immediately felt the difference when going for a jog in my neighborhood. There are steep (I'm guessing 45&#176; incline, if not more!) hills everywhere I go. Most of the time I'm out of breath when I reach the top (that is, the top of the block, not the actual hill). I'm really looking forward to reaping the benefits of these hill repeats. </p> <br> <div class="post-status-button-div" data-attribute="hidden"> <button class="button-reply">Reply</button> </div> <form class="hidden reply-form"> Reply:<br> <input type="text" name="reply"> <input type="radio" name="location" value="location"> Include location<br> <input type="submit" value="Post"> </form> </div> <hr> <div class="post"> <img class="article_img" src="e.jpg" alt="user josh"/> <h3>Josh Parkin</h3> <h4>February 5, 2016</h4> <br> <p> Running on treadmills. Since I am a night owl, I prefer to run in the evening so running on a treadmill is more convenient for me as it's safer. </p> <br> <div class="post-status-button-div" data-attribute="hidden"> <button class="button-reply">Reply</button> </div> <form class="hidden reply-form"> Reply:<br> <input type="text" name="reply"> <input type="radio" name="location" value="location"> Include location<br> <input type="submit" value="Post"> </form> </div> <hr> <div class="post"> <img class="article_img" src="5.jpg" alt="user sophie"/> <h3>Sophie Rigault-Barbier</h3> <h4>February 4, 2016</h4> <br> <p> Training for San Francisco half marathon. It all started again in 2008 when I wanted to go back to sports but didn’t want to spend too much money in fitness club. Thereby I decided to challenge myself and ask a friend to train with me at running: only running shoes and fresh air – that was a good goal. </p> <br> <div class="post-status-button-div" data-attribute="hidden"> <button class="button-reply">Reply</button> </div> <form class="hidden reply-form"> Reply:<br> <input type="text" name="reply"> <input type="radio" name="location" value="location"> Include location<br> <input type="submit" value="Post"> </form> </div> <hr> <div class="post"> <img class="article_img" src="5.jpg" alt="user sophie"/> <h3>Sophie Rigault-Barbier</h3> <h4>February 4, 2016</h4> <br> <p> So I started and as I used to do competition, I decided to train for a half marathon. I ran 2 of them and had to stop for my little one. Today is a new part of challenge and hopefully I will go back to running again for the SF half marathon. </p> <br> <div class="post-status-button-div" data-attribute="hidden"> <button class="button-reply">Reply</button> </div> <form class="hidden reply-form"> Reply:<br> <input type="text" name="reply"> <input type="radio" name="location" value="location"> Include location<br> <input type="submit" value="Post"> </form> </div> <hr> <div class="post"> <img class="article_img" src="6.jpg" alt="user electra"/> <h3>Electra Chong</h3> <h4>February 3, 2016</h4> <br> <p> Secretly running at night. Running was the type of activity I abhorred in high school. Though I admired the discipline and endurance of those who ran, I myself had no will to stomach the side stitches, aching lungs and mild nausea from prolonged running. </p> <br> <div class="post-status-button-div" data-attribute="hidden"> <button class="button-reply">Reply</button> </div> <form class="hidden reply-form"> Reply:<br> <input type="text" name="reply"> <input type="radio" name="location" value="location"> Include location<br> <input type="submit" value="Post"> </form> </div> <hr> <div class="post"> <img class="article_img" src="6.jpg" alt="user electra"/> <h3>Electra Chong</h3> <h4>February 3, 2016</h4> <br> <p> This changed when I met Siphan and learned about her experience running marathons from her personal website, <a href="http://amsterunner.com/" target="_blank">amsterunner.com</a>. I felt we were similar in spirit, and yet she had managed so much personal growth by pushing herself. After being inspired by her, I secretly started running at night so I limit my embarrassment as a beginner. My night runs were chilly and lonesome, but worth it. NO PAIN, NO GAIN. </p> <br> <div class="post-status-button-div" data-attribute="hidden"> <button class="button-reply">Reply</button> </div> <form class="hidden reply-form"> Reply:<br> <input type="text" name="reply"> <input type="radio" name="location" value="location"> Include location<br> <input type="submit" value="Post"> </form> </div> <hr> <div class="post"> <img class="article_img" src="7.jpg" alt="user marine"/> <h3>Marine Dejean</h3> <h4>February 2, 2016</h4> <br> <p> Running outdoors.

I used to run cross-country races with distances up to 10 miles. Unfortunately, I suffered a knee injury and I've been really careful about my training ever since. I recently picked up running again but have to build up slowly so as to ease the impact on my knees. </p> <br> <div class="post-status-button-div" data-attribute="hidden"> <button class="button-reply">Reply</button> </div> <form class="hidden reply-form"> Reply:<br> <input type="text" name="reply"> <input type="radio" name="location" value="location"> Include location<br> <input type="submit" value="Post"> </form> </div> <hr> <div class="post"> <img class="article_img" src="f.jpg" alt="user rona"/> <h3>Rona Chong</h3> <h4>January 22, 2016</h4> <br> <p> I actually don't like running, but my sister has been sneaking out to run at night and as I'm a competitive person this has given me the courage to pick up running too.
